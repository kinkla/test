When I just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (ah)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? (Ah)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (ah)
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you (ah)
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma!?
Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen' in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinn vrinn, vrinn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
